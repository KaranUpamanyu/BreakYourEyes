Hi! This is BreakYourEyes (aka 𝐵𝓎𝑒).

You can install this app by downloading the DMG file in this repo.
If you've got trust issues, you could also clone the repo and build it yourself.

This is a minimalist app that lies on the Menu Bar. It has 2 states- enabled 🟢 and disabled 🔴.

When the app is enabled, it shows you a translucent panel every 20 minutes obstructing whatever you're doing at the moment, encouraging you to take a 20-second break.

The app has no windows or other UI - it quietly lies in the Menu Bar and the Dock.
